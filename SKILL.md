# Just Cause Development

Help organizations articulate a Just Cause - a vision of a future state so appealing that people will make sacrifices to advance toward it.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create Just Causes that serve harmful, exclusionary, or exploitative ends
- Help weaponize purpose to manipulate employees
- Manufacture causes that don't authentically reflect organizational beliefs

**A Just Cause must be ethical.** Causes built on deception, division, or harm are not Just Causes - they're manipulation.

---

## When to Use

- Vision statements feel hollow or uninspiring
- Organization has a Why but no clear direction ("We believe in X, but where are we going?")
- User asks about long-term purpose beyond profit
- Organization wants to inspire sacrifice and commitment
- Mission needs to withstand leadership changes and market shifts
- User mentions "our vision doesn't motivate anyone"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **current_vision** | No | Existing vision/mission statements |
| **organizational_why** | No | The organization's purpose (Why it exists) |
| **aspirations** | Yes | What change does the organization want to make in the world? |
| **history** | No | Origin stories, pivotal moments, or founding beliefs |

---

## Just Cause vs. Other Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Orientation |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **WHY** | Purpose, cause, belief - why you exist | Origin (where you come from) |
| **Just Cause** | Vision of a future worth sacrificing for | Destination (where you're going) |
| **Mission** | Specific objective to accomplish | Tactical (what you'll do) |
| **Goal** | Measurable target to achieve | Finite (something to complete) |

**Key insight:** Your Why is discovered (it already exists). Your Just Cause is articulated (it describes a future not yet achieved).

---

## The Five Criteria of a Just Cause

A Just Cause must be:

### 1. FOR Something (Affirmative)
- Stands FOR a positive vision, not AGAINST an enemy
- Resilient to external changes (enemies can be defeated; visions endure)
- Inspires advance, not just defense

**Test:** Does it describe what you're building, not what you're fighting?

**Weak:** "Disrupt the banking industry"
**Strong:** "A world where everyone has access to financial opportunity"

### 2. Inclusive
- Open to all who wish to contribute
- Creates belonging for diverse participants
- Anyone can see themselves in the cause

**Test:** Could someone new join and immediately understand how they fit?

**Weak:** "The best engineering team in the valley"
**Strong:** "Technology that empowers every human"

### 3. Service-Oriented
- Benefits others, not just the organization
- Focused on those you serve, not on winning or profit
- Would exist even if the organization didn't

**Test:** Does someone outside your organization benefit?

**Weak:** "Be the market leader in cloud computing"
**Strong:** "A future where any business can compete with giants"

### 4. Resilient
- Can survive changes in products, services, markets, and leadership
- Not dependent on specific conditions
- Endures across generations

**Test:** Would this still matter in 50 years?

**Weak:** "The world's most popular social network"
**Strong:** "A more connected world where no one feels alone"

### 5. Idealistic
- Big enough to never be fully achieved
- A direction, not a destination
- Inspires continuous effort

**Test:** Can you ever finish and declare victory?

**Weak:** "100% renewable energy by 2030" (goal, not cause)
**Strong:** "A world that works with nature, not against it"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Current State

Evaluate existing vision/mission against the five criteria:

| Criterion | Present? | Issue |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Affirmative | Yes/No | [What's the gap?] |
| Inclusive | Yes/No | [What's the gap?] |
| Service-Oriented | Yes/No | [What's the gap?] |
| Resilient | Yes/No | [What's the gap?] |
| Idealistic | Yes/No | [What's the gap?] |

**Common problems:**
- Goals masquerading as causes ("Be #1 in our market")
- Self-serving focus ("Be the most profitable company")
- Finite endpoints ("Cure cancer" is a goal; "A world without suffering from disease" is a cause)
- Against-framing ("Destroy the competition")

### Step 2: Excavate the Ideal

If no clear Just Cause exists, explore:

1. **Future State Questions:**
   - What world are you trying to build?
   - If you fully succeeded, what would be different?
   - What injustice or suffering motivates you?

2. **Sacrifice Questions:**
   - What would people sacrifice for?
   - What cause is worth more than money?
   - What would make the hard times worth enduring?

3. **Legacy Questions:**
   - What do you want to be true in 100 years because of your work?
   - What would you want your great-grandchildren to inherit?
   - If the organization disappeared, what loss would the world feel?

### Step 3: Draft the Just Cause

Construct a statement that:
- Describes a future state (not a current action)
- Meets all five criteria
- Inspires emotional connection
- Guides decisions ("Does this advance our cause?")

**Format options:**
- "A world where [vision]"
- "A future in which [condition]"
- "[Beneficiary] who [benefit]"

### Step 4: Stress Test

Challenge the draft:

| Test | Question | Pass/Fail |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Endurance** | Will this still matter in 50 years? | |
| **Sacrifice** | Would people sacrifice for this? | |
| **Authenticity** | Does this genuinely reflect beliefs? | |
| **Independence** | Does this require defeating an enemy? | |
| **Openness** | Can anyone contribute? | |

### Step 5: Connect to Action

Link the Just Cause to daily decisions:

- How does this guide strategy?
- How does this influence hiring?
- How does this resolve conflicts?
- What should we stop doing because it doesn't advance the cause?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User provides goal, not cause | Reframe: "That's a milestone. What's the world you're building toward?" |
| Cause is "against" something | Flip to affirmative: "If that enemy didn't exist, what would you build?" |
| Cause is self-serving | Push outward: "Who benefits beyond your organization?" |
| Organization has no cause | Explore origin stories and moments of pride to discover one |
| Cause conflicts with actual behavior | Note the gap; a cause must be authentic or it breeds cynicism |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
"Our vision is 'To be the leading provider of sustainable packaging solutions.' We've had this for years but it doesn't inspire anyone."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Just Cause Development

### Current State Assessment
| Criterion | Present? | Issue |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Affirmative | Partial | "Leading provider" is competitive framing |
| Inclusive | Weak | Speaks to company position, not broader community |
| Service-Oriented | Weak | Focus on being "leading," not on who benefits |
| Resilient | Weak | "Sustainable packaging" may change; what if packaging becomes obsolete? |
| Idealistic | No | "Leading provider" is achievable (and lose-able) |

**Summary:** This is a competitive positioning statement, not a Just Cause. It describes what you want to BE (market leader), not what world you're BUILDING. No one sacrifices for "leading provider" status.

### Your Just Cause

**"A world where commerce leaves no trace - where every product can exist without burdening future generations."**

**Why this works:**
- **Affirmative:** FOR a clean future, not AGAINST pollution
- **Inclusive:** Anyone who cares about sustainability can contribute
- **Service-Oriented:** Benefits future generations and the planet
- **Resilient:** Works whether packaging, shipping, or something we haven't invented yet
- **Idealistic:** "No trace" is a direction, never fully achieved

### Stress Test
| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Endurance | Pass | Environmental stewardship will matter in 50+ years |
| Sacrifice | Pass | People will work harder, accept less profit for this |
| Authenticity | TBD | Does your team actually believe this? Verify. |
| Independence | Pass | Doesn't require defeating a competitor |
| Openness | Pass | Anyone who cares can contribute |

### Connecting Cause to Action

**Strategy:** Evaluate every decision by "Does this move us toward commerce without trace?"
**People:** Hire people who care about environmental legacy, not just packaging expertise
**Decisions:** When cheaper but less sustainable options exist, the cause guides the choice

### What to Stop
- Messaging focused on "market leadership" or competitive positioning
- Any product line that doesn't authentically advance the cause
- Celebrating wins that are about beating competitors, not advancing sustainability
